	 * This implementation scans the freeList, looking for the first free memory block 
	 * whose length equals at least the given length. If such a block is found, the method 
	 * performs the following operations:
	 * 
	 * (1) A new memory block is constructed. The base address of the new block is set to
	 * the base address of the found free block. The length of the new block is set to the value 
	 * of the method's length parameter.
	 * 
	 * (2) The new memory block is appended to the end of the allocatedList.
	 * 
	 * (3) The base address and the length of the found free block are updated, to reflect the allocation.
	 * For example, suppose that the requested block length is 17, and suppose that the base
	 * address and length of the the found free block are 250 and 20, respectively.
	 * In such a case, the base address and length of of the allocated block
	 * are set to 250 and 17, respectively, and the base address and length
	 * of the found free block are set to 267 and 3, respectively.
	 * 
	 * (4) The new memory block is returned.
	 * 
	 * If the length of the found block is exactly the same as the requested length, 
	 * then the found block is removed from the freeList and appended to the allocatedList.
	 * 
	 * @param length
	 *        the length (in words) of the memory block that has to be allocated
	 * @return the base address of the allocated block, or -1 if unable to allocate
